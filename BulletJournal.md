After being challenged in class to keep a bullet journal, I bought one off of Amazon and started it as soon as it came in the mail.  It really helped me to organize my thoughts and figure out just what I was trying to accomplish both in the short term and the long term.  I had previously been keeping track of my schedule with google calendars.  The bullet journal had several advantages and disadvantages to the old system.  The biggest advantage was that I seemed to remember things better when I actually write things down rather than type them up.  I was also able to use the space more creatively.  The biggest disadvantage was that my handwriting is terrible, so I either had to write very slowly and take way more time, or I had to risk not being able to read it.  The second biggest disadvantage was that it never sent me any reminder alerts as it was just a journal.  Overall, it was an educational experience and I do not plan to continue the habit into next semester.  I tweeted out my experience on twitter under the handle @BrenanStewart1
